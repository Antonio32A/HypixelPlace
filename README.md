Autoplace will place pixels for you. To activate it press P on your keyboard.

**WARNING**: Autoplace is use at your own risk. It attempts to mimic human behavior but I do not guarantee that you will not get rate-limited. 
(As far as I know reddit will not fully ban your account and will just force you to wait a long long time before placing)
